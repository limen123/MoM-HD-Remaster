INSTRUCTIONS
SKIP TO BOTTOM OF INSTRUCTIONS IF YOU ARE UPDATING FROM V0.1

1. Download the songpack on github or from one of the following mirrors:

MEGA: https://mega.nz/file/qEIlEQ4K#WP56xKmx0EB1CXGmFkWiOwOKan-cPAYIe4QeHlNfTs0

GOOGLE DRIVE: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s4jTTS-67YtoaaN3AKU6JNiRiv-jMFdk/view?usp=sharing


- After extracting, you should end up with a Remasters folder. Within it should be a "I.5 and II.5"
  and a "KH3" folder.

2. Download the 3 batch files on github. You should have:
	- 1ST STEP - CREATE BACKUPS.bat
	- 2ND STEP - INSTALLER.bat
	- OPTIONAL - SAVE BACKUP.bat

3. Create a new folder and place the Remasters folder and the 3 batch files inside.
	- You can name this new folder whatever you want.
	- The contents of the folder should now look like this:
	![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27838339/120083469-d8cef000-c096-11eb-8503-5847985fb5d4.png)


3. Run the 1ST STEP batch file located in the pack to create backups of the original songs.
	- By default, your game should be in "C:\Program Files\Epic Games\KH_MoM". If it is not, you
	  will have to locate it yourself. Try searching "KH_MoM" if you're having trouble.
	- After the backups are created, your folder should now look like this:
	![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27838339/120083494-0caa1580-c097-11eb-9c3f-e861bddc88b6.png)


4. Once you have finished creating backups, run the 2ND STEP batch file located in the pack.
   For subsequent uses, you ONLY need to run THIS BATCH FILE. You do not need to create
   backups every time.
	- "Originals" will undo all replacements and reset you with the original songs.
	- "Remasters" will replace your songs with the Remastered versions from the
	   HD Collections. You can choose between One-Winged Angel KH1 or KH2.
	- "KH3" will replace your songs with the KH3 versions.
	- Again, if the game directory is not found, it will ask you to insert manually.

PLEASE NOTE THAT SOME KH3 SONGS WILL OVERLAP WITH THE REMASTERS. You can use both at the
same time if you'd like, though any KH3 song that overlaps with the Remastered versions
cannot be played at the same time. Installing Remaster and then KH3 will replace the
Remastered songs with KH3 where applicable, while leaving the rest of the Remastered songs
still playable.



OPTIONAL BATCH FILE
 - If you would like to create a backup of your save file, run this file and follow the
   instructions. After the backup is complete, you can save it wherever you want.
 - To restore the save, copy the contents of "Save Backup" and place it in:

%CD%:\Users\\%USERNAME%\Documents\KINGDOM HEARTS Melody of Memory\Epic Games Store\
- %CD% being your main drive
- %USERNAME% being your PC username


#IF YOU ARE UPDATING FROM v0.1
Download the Remasters zip from the mirrors or the release page. Download the NEW 2ND STEP batch.
Replace the Remasters folder and the 2ND STEP batch in your designated mod folder and run
2ND STEP as usual to install the new updates.

There will be a new prompt when choosing Remasters to pick between KH1 or KH2 OWA
