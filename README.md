INSTRUCTIONS


1. Run the 1ST STEP batch file located in the pack to create backups of the original songs.
	- By default, your game should be in "C:\Program Files\KH_MoM". If it is not, you
	  will have to locate it yourself. Try searching "KH_MoM" if you're having trouble.

2. Once you have finished creating backups, run the 2ND STEP batch file located in the pack.
   For subsequent uses, you ONLY need to run THIS BATCH FILE. You do not need to create
   backups every time.
	- "Originals" will undo all replacements and reset you with the original songs.
	- "Remasters" will replace your songs with the Remastered versions from the
	   HD Collections.
	- "KH3" will replace your songs with the KH3 versions.
	- Again, if the game directory is not found, it will ask you to insert manually.

PLEASE NOTE THAT SOME KH3 SONGS WILL OVERLAP WITH THE REMASTERS. You can use both at the
same time if you'd like.
	- Installing Remaster and then KH3 will replace the Remastered songs with KH3 where
	  applicable, while leaving the rest of the Remastered songs still playable



OPTIONAL BATCH FILE
 - If you would like to create a backup of your save file, run this file on your main drive
   (where your documents, downloads, etc are) and follow the instructions. After the backup
   is complete, you can save it wherever you want.
